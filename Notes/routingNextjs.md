# Routing

## Understanding Fle-based Routing

### File-based Routing Instead Of Code-based Routing

- No react-router
- no in-code route definitions

â˜… Create React component files and let NextJS infer the routes from the file system(= folder structure)

### How It Works

```
/pages
  /index.js : Main stating page(my-domain.com/)
  /about.js : About page(my-domain.com/about)

  /products
    /index.js : All products page(my-domain.com/products)
    /[id].js : Single product detail page(my-domain.com/products/<id>)
```

## Static & Dynamic Routes

## Navigating Between pages
